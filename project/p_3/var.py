# A variable is like a container that stores a value

# Creating a variable and assigning a value
name = "Alice"  # This variable stores a string
age = 25        # This variable stores a number

# Printing the values of the variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)

# Changing the value of a variable
age = age + 1  # Now the age is increased by 1

# Printing the updated value
print("New Age:", age)
